# How to build Semicom devices and appliances

**Standards and Features-**The "Pagent" is the smallest element in the Pentelebet's Transcom circuit. It is a simple semicom device similar to a microcontroller that maintains the exhibit and display data of its main embedded system.

  
**Embodiement** **\(Electroplate\)-**The Pagent is built differently based upon the alphabetical family it supports. They all have the same component modules which maintain ancilliary data model \(ADM\) sets and codes of instruction \(COI\) encoded in the character devices which operate within the Transcom.The modules can be seen here:

* Stylus modules: Core class, used to build and plot pagent coordinates
* Tincture modules: Plotted paths within the Transcom
* Armature modules: Used to cache DFN transfers
* Platform modules: Supports maintenance and programming routines

**Language and Methods** **\(Beamology\)-**The primary functions used to operate pagent devices are:

* Beam Base: The hardware address of the codesmith.
* Beam Start: The address from which a new command or circuit is initiated.
* Beam Point: The current address of any access group.
* Beam Stop: The final address for any particular execution.

  
All functions are inter-dependent of Beamology. These functions are hard coded into the hardware and tag each circuit and their components with certificates based upon Semicom specification. They allow refactoring of structured beamplans and maximize Semicom and pagent device package compatibility.

  
There are seven \(7\) regions of all beamplan architecture:

####     **Shell**: 

         Shields package from data breaches.

    **Transducer**: 

         Transfers filtered data.

    **Address Array**: 

         Aggregates DFN data arrays.

    **Processor Package**: 

         Preparation DFN wrapper.

    **Lobe Liner**: 

         Layering for data extensibility.

    **Electroplate**: 

         Entry and exit of DFN.

    **Socket Carrier**: 

         Semicom device form factor.



The Pentelebets system of programming is used by engineers and scientists to compute large processes and enterprise grade networking of data. Although based upon the QWERTY characters on any keyboard, their usage does not build words and paragraphs, but form a series of number crunching parse processes. 

In embedded Pentelebets; \(languages that have already been encoded in a package or machine\) there are seven types of characters,  

1. Stationary 
2. Transcom 
3. Ancilliary 
4. Packaging 
5. Layering 
6. Environmental 
7. Super-Cluster 

* The first type "stationary" is locked into its host machine and programmed according to ports and slots of its carrier package. 
* The second type ; "transcom" is parsed against the first in a series of inspections to check for matching COI designator tags. 
* The third type; "Ancilliary" is used by codesmiths to maintain security routines or encrypted  data. 
* The fourth type; "packaging" is used to package SoC, FPGA, VHDL and other refactored or repurposed documents. 
* The fifth type; "layering" is used when debugging or building more developed code output. 
* The sixth type; "environmental" is used in buffering designators and or DFN data that is passed by the designated within the Transcom. 
* The seventh type; "super-cluster" is used to archive or compress voluminous data.
