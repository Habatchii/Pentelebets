# How to build Semicom devices and appliances

**Standards and Features-**The "Pagent" is the smallest element in the Pentelebet's Transcom circuit. It is a simple semicom device similar to a microcontroller that maintains the exhibit and display data of its main embedded system.

  
**Embodiement** **\(Electroplate\)-**The Pagent is built differently based upon the alphabetical family it supports. They all have the same component modules which maintain ancilliary data model \(ADM\) sets and codes of instruction \(COI\) encoded in the character devices which operate within the Transcom.The modules can be seen here:

* Stylus modules: Core class, used to build and plot pagent coordinates
* Tincture modules: Plotted paths within the Transcom
* Armature modules: Used to cache DFN transfers
* Platform modules: Supports maintenance and programming routines

**Language and Methods** **\(Beamology\)-**The primary functions used to operate pagent devices are:

* Beam Base: The hardware address of the codesmith.
* Beam Start: The address from which a new command or circuit is initiated.
* Beam Point: The current address of any access group.
* Beam Stop: The final address for any particular execution.

  
All functions are inter-dependent of Beamology. These functions are hard coded into the hardware and tag each circuit and their components with certificates based upon Semicom specification. They allow refactoring of structured beamplans and maximize Semicom and pagent device package compatibility.

  
There are seven \(7\) regions of all beamplan architecture:

####     **Shell**: 

         Shields package from data breaches.

    **Transducer**: 

         Transfers filtered data.

    **Address Array**: 

         Aggregates DFN data arrays.

    **Processor Package**: 

         Preparation DFN wrapper.

    **Lobe Liner**: 

         Layering for data extensibility.

    **Electroplate**: 

         Entry and exit of DFN.

    **Socket Carrier**: 

         Semicom device form factor.
